## Additional GitHub triggers for Zapier

I was looking for a way to automatically bookmark [every GitHub repo I star](https://github.com/stars). 

I couldn't find anything, and existing GitHub extensions for IFTTT and Zapier didn't expose 
any _new starred repo_ triggers, so I created this.

## Usage

Since there's already an official GitHub extension for Zapier, this extension is invite-only.

If you'd like to use it, [get in touch](https://twitter.com/steveWINton) and I'll add you to the app :smile:

For connecting the extension to your GitHub account, I recommend creating a [personal API token](https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens).
